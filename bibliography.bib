@article{Fatemi1988,
abstract = {A modification to Brown and Miller's critical plane approach is proposed to predict multiaxial fatigue life under both in-phase and out-of-phase loading conditions. The components of this modified parameter consist of the maximum shear strain amplitude and the maximum normal stress on the maximum shear strain amplitude plane. Additional cyclic hardening developed during out-of-phase loading is included in the normal stress term. Also, the mathematical formulation of this new parameter is such that variable amplitude loading can be accommodated. Experimental results from tubular specimens made of 1045 HR steel under in-phase and 90 degree out-of-phase axial-torsional straining using both sinusoidal and trapezoidal wave forms were correlated within a factor of about two employing this approach. Available Inconel 718 axial-torsional data including mean strain histories were also satisfactorily correlated using the aforementioned parameter.},

@article{Wang1993,
abstract = {A path-independent multiaxial fatigue damage criterion is proposed based on critical plane concepts: fatigue crack growth is controlled by the maximum shear strain, and an important secondary effect is due to the normal strain excursion over one reversal of the maximum shear strain. The effect of loading path on fatigue endurance is quantified by the normal strain excursion. Only one multiaxial material constant is required in the model which can be determined from uniaxial test data plus one torsional result. The parameter can be easily integrated with a shear strain-life relationship to predict low cycle fatigue lifetime. Experimental data of four different materials: En1 5R steel, I{\%} Cr-Mo-V steel, 304 stainless steel, and 316 stainless steel at two temperatures were used to verify the criterion. It is shown that the proposed parameter can satisfactorily correlate test results for various proportional and non-proportional straining paths.},

@article{McClaflin2004,
abstract = {This study investigates torsional deformation and fatigue behavior of both solid and thin-walled tube specimens made of a high strength quenched and tempered spring steel. Uniaxial deformation and fatigue data of this steel were already available. Monotonic and cyclic deformation curves are predicted from the von Mises and Tresca criteria and compared to the torsional data. Three types of torsional fatigue tests involving shear mean stress as well as tensile and compressive mean stresses were also performed in order to gain a better understanding as to how to predict the behavior of the material under such loading. The stress-life (S-N) approach and strain-life curve based on commonly used failure criteria are evaluated. Failure modes and fracture surfaces were observed and are discussed with regards to the failure criteria commonly used for life predictions. The differences in cyclic deformation and fatigue behaviors between solid round specimens where a stress gradient exists, and thin-walled tube specimens where a uniform stress state is commonly assumed, are also discussed. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
